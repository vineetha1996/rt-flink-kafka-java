# What is Apache Flink?
Apache Flink is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams. Flink has been designed to run in all common cluster environments, perform computations at in-memory speed and at any scale.

#### Data can be processed as unbounded or bounded streams.

#### Unbounded Streams:
Unbounded streams have a start but no defined end. They do not terminate and provide data as it is generated.

#### Bounded Streams:
Bounded streams have a defined start and end. Bounded streams can be processed by ingesting all data before performing any computations.

- Apache Flink excels at processing unbounded and bounded data sets. 
- Precise control of time and state enable Flink’s runtime to run any kind of application on unbounded streams. 
- Bounded streams are internally processed by algorithms and data structures that are specifically designed for fixed sized data sets, yielding excellent performance.

#### USES:
- Apache Flink is an excellent choice to develop and run many different types of applications due to its extensive features set. Flink’s features include support for stream and batch processing, sophisticated state management, event-time processing semantics, and exactly-once consistency guarantees for state.

#### Run Applications at any Scale:
- applications processing multiple trillions of events per day,
- applications maintaining multiple terabytes of state, and
- applications running on thousands of cores.
